### Introduction
When I was in college, I wanted to cook for myself as much as possible since I didn't like eating out. I wanted my food to be fresh, healthy, and to my taste, and to be able to eat whatever I wanted. Unfortunately, I very rarely actually cooked. Takes too much time and effort to buy ingredients, prepare recipe, utensils, etc. I asked myself the question: What combination of ingredients can I buy that will ensure I can cook X many recipes,  and have X many servings of each? The reason this question is so important to me, is because once I can answer this question, theoretically, all I need to do is go buy the ingredients from the store (that this software tells me to buy), and thats it!

### Python Code
There is one big problem with the current code that I haven't yet addressed/solved, which I would like to. It's not actually a bug, as the code still runs fine, it's a efficiency problem. Basically, everytime I run the code, the computer goes first through the process of loading all the data it needs, and then only goes through the manipulation/processing code portion.
