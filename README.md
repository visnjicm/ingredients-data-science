### Introduction
When I was in college, I wanted to cook for myself as much as possible since I didn't like eating out. I wanted my food to be fresh, healthy, and to my taste, and to be able to eat whatever I wanted. Unfortunately, I very rarely actually cooked. Takes too much time and effort to buy ingredients, prepare recipe, utensils, etc. I asked myself the question: What combination of ingredients can I buy that will ensure I can cook X many recipes,  and have X many servings of each? The reason this question is so important to me, is because once I can answer this question, theoretically, all I need to do is go buy the ingredients from the store (that this software tells me to buy), and thats it!
